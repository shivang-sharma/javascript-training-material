/**
 * Symbol:
 * A value having the data type Symbol can be referred to as a symbol value. 
 * Symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique.
 * Symbol is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive 
 * also called a Symbol value or just a Symbol â€” that's guaranteed to be unique.
 * Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object that won't 
 * collide with keys any other code might add to the object, and which are hidden
 * from any mechanisms other code will typically use to access the object.
 * That enables a form of weak encapsulation, or a weak form of information hiding.
 * 
 * Every Symbol() call is guaranteed to return a unique Symbol. 
 * Every Symbol.for("key") call will always return the same Symbol for 
 * a given value of "key". When Symbol.for("key") is called, if a Symbol 
 * with the given key can be found in the global Symbol registry, that Symbol 
 * is returned. Otherwise, a new Symbol is created, added to the global Symbol
 * registry under the given key, and returned.

// Two symbols with the same description

// const value1 = Symbol('hello');

// let result = (value1 === value2) ? true : false;  // false;
// console.log(result);
// Note: Though value1 and value2 both contain 'hello', 
// they are different as they are of the Symbol type.


// To access the description of a symbol, we use the . operator. 
// For example,

// const x = Symbol('hey');
// console.log(x.description); // hey

/**
 * Whenever there are inheritance hierarchies in JavaScript, you have two
 * kinds of properties. 
 * Public properties are seen by clients of the code
 * Private properties are used internally within the pieces that make up the 
 * inheritance hierarchy (e.g. classes, objects).
 * For usability's sake, public properties usually have string keys.
 * But for private properties with string keys, accidental name clashes 
 * can become a problem. 
 * Therefore, symbols are a good choice.

/**
 * Symbol Property
 *    Name                                Description
 * Symbol.hasInstance         It is used to determine if a constructor object recognizes an object 
 *                            as its instance.
 * Symbol.isConcatSpreadable  It is used to configure if an object should be flattened to its 
 *                            array elements.
 * Symbol.match               It is a method to identify the matching of a regular expression 
 *                            against a string.
 * Symbol.prototype           It is used for produce the prototype for the symbol constructor.
 * Symbol.replace             It replace matched substring of a string.
 * Symbol.search              It returns the index within a string that matches with the regular
 *                            expression.
 * Symbol.split               It splits a string at the indices that match the regular expression.
 * Symbol.toPrimitive	        It is used to convert an object to its equivalent primitive value.
 * Symbol.unscopables         It is a well-known object property whose property name are excluded
 *                            from with environment.
 * 
 * Symbol Methods
 *    Name                                Description
 * Symbol.for()               It is used to search for existing symbol in a runtime-wide symbol
 *                            registry with the provided key and returns if it is found. 
 *                            Otherwise new symbol gets created with this key.
 * Symbol.keyFor()            It uses the global symbol registry to look up the key for the symbol.
 *                            So it doesn't work for non-global symbols. If the symbol is not global,
 *                            it won't be able to find it and returns undefined.
 * Symbol.toString()          It is used to return a string representation of an object.
